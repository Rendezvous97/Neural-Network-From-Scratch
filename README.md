# Neural-Network-From-Scratch

## Project Description
 Implementing an Artificial Neural Network based on Adrej Karpathy's Micrograd's tutorial. The video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0).

 This repo includes two different implementationsâ€”one in vanilla python and the other in pyTorch.

### Note: 
 In the vanilla python version, we make a scalar equivalent of tensors to represent the data and perform specific operations.

## Mind Map
 I also made a mind map for this tutorial which can be found [here](https://whimsical.com/spelled-out-intro-to-neural-networks-andrej-karpoathy-QsetAoDdhRosU56Vt71rNT), on Whimsical. If you have any suggestions or edits, please feel free to raise an issue on the repo.


 To run the vanilla python files:

 1. Download this repo
 2. cd to the folder "neural-network-from-scratch"
 3. cd "Vanilla Python Implementation"
 4. cd "Python Files"
 5. python training_adv_ex.py
